Project Overview

    Distributed Student Analyser is a Python-based desktop app for managing and analyzing student records across branches. Built with CustomTkinter, SQLite, and Matplotlib, it supports quick CRUD operations, sorting, and searching through a modern interface.
    The dashboard also includes a Summary Statistics panel that visualizes branch-wise performance, marks trends, and attendance data—automatically highlighting students with attendance below 75%.
